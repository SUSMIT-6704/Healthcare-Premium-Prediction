## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and analyzed data for missing values and outliers.
- Feature engineering to improve model performance.

### 2. Model Building
- Built regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost).
- **XGBoost** achieved **98% accuracy** on test data.

### 3. Error Analysis
- Performed residual analysis to evaluate prediction quality.

### 4. Interactive UI
- Created a **Streamlit app** to:
  - Accept user input for predictions.
  - Display predicted premiums in real-time.
